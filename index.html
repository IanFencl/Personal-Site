                                    <li>My main focus has been on object-oriented programming. I have taken multiple classes on C# as well as Java where we wrote business focused apps.</li><br>
                                    <li> During my time at Sun Life, I used C# to take an app from an idea to production and learned a lot about communicating expectations and planning for scalability. In addition to the app, I was responsible for completing mail merges and branding updates using FusionPro and JavaScript.</li><br>
                                    <li> I have also taken classes on SQL where I have deployed and updated databases using AWS. In addition, I completed networking and web development classes where I learned about Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and how to use the Flask framework.</li><br>
                                    <li>I have years of customer service experience where I learned to think of creative solutions, perform well on a team, and deal with customers.</li></ul></p> </div></div>

                            <p>I am very eager to learn new things as well as polish my existing skills. I enjoy making things and being proud of the finished product which is why I am after a software/web developer role. I am a hard worker and have experience in fast paced environments so I am not afraid of a deadline. I am a team player who always does my best and I like to think outside of the box. </p> </div> </div>
